# SEA-Testbed
## Preface
I decided to publish my bachelor’s thesis here on GitHub because I want to give something back to the open-source community. I’ve always believed that knowledge should be shared freely, and while working on this thesis I relied on a lot of open-source tools, projects, and resources. Making my work public feels like the right way to pass that help forward and hopefully support others in their own projects.
Unfortunately, I can’t share everything that went into this thesis -- the code I wrote and the CAD files I designed can’t be released publicly -- but I can at least provide the full written thesis and the insights I gained along the way.
I’d also like to thank my supervisors once again for their support, patience, and guidance. I learned a lot throughout this journey and genuinely enjoyed the process.

## Abstract of this Thesis
This thesis presents the design, implementation, and validation of a modular testbed for evaluating torsional springs in Series Elastic Actuators (SEAs), targeting their application in compliant robotic joints. SEAs offer intrinsic mechanical compliance through a spring integrated in series between actuator and link, enabling improved force control, shock tolerance, and energy efficiency. The developed testbed supports a static configuration in which a force torque sensor is connected to the testbed, making the link rigid. This enables the deflection of a spring, and further the evaluation of stiffness and energy loss by capturing a springs hysteresis. Furthermore, in dynamic configuration, this sensor is
removed, allowing the link rotate freely and evaluate a springs dynamic damping behavior as well as the evaluation of custom controller strategies.

The core objective was to build a low-cost, test platform with support for both static and dynamic spring testing to evaluate torsional springs for Series Elastic Actuators in elastic robot joints. It shall be able to accommodate different spring sizes and be modular in nature. Additionally, a real-time capable software framework to facilitate communication with an actuator and sensors shall be provided to enable testings and incorporate custom user parameters for various tests including static, dynamic and control evaluation. 

The testbed was built and evaluated using three torsional springs generated with an open-source MATLAB-based spring design tool [1]. These springs have been optimized for fused deposition modeling 3D printing and manufactured out of PLA, PETG, and PC-ABS. Results showed that PC-ABS performs best across most metrics, demonstrating linear stiffness and minimal damping. However, the evaluation also revealed mechanical limitations, such as compliance in the drive shaft and communication delays in the actuator, which currently limit the system’s suitability for real-time control due to a low control frequency. Requiring replacement of the actuator to improve dynamic testing and a change of mechanical linkage or isolation of the spring measurement to improve the static test range. Nevertheless, the testbed provides a validated foundation for future research on compliant actuator design, control strategies, and spring optimization in robotic systems.
